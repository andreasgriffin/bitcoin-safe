"""Utilities for verifying Bitcoin signed messages.

This module implements verification of messages signed by Bitcoin private keys
using the **Bitcoin Signed Message** format (i.e., the format used by Core,
Electrum, hardware wallets, etc.).

Key points this module enforces and explains inline:

* The *message magic* prefix (``"\x18Bitcoin Signed Message:\n"``) and a
  varint-encoded message length are prepended before double-SHA256 hashing.
* The signature is expected in Base64, consisting of a 65-byte compact
  recoverable signature: 1 header byte + 64 bytes of (r||s).
* The header byte encodes both the recovery id (0-3) and whether the original
  public key was compressed (adds 4 when compressed), following the de-facto
  standard used by Bitcoin Core.
* We recover the public key from the signature and message hash, then check
  that the provided address corresponds to that key for all supported network
  address types (legacy Base58 P2PKH/P2SH and Bech32 P2WPKH).

The functions include detailed docstrings and inline comments explaining *why*
we do each step, not just *what* we do, to aid reviewers and future maintainers.
